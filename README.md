# Secretary Owl (PWA Hackathon 2017 Project)

Our use of Asana (https://app.asana.com)  has a problem when the task creation rate in each day is very high. We have to always waste time rearrange the due date and reassign the tasks.

This application (Secretary Owl) will help us handle this problem. He can 

1. login to your Asana account
2. suggest a task you should do next
3. postpone due date and rearrange the priority of tasks
4. notify you when a task has been assigned to you
5. notify you when someone commented in a task you follow
6. notify you when your tasks are over due
7. you can command him by voice or by choosing the job from menu, he use Chrome speech recognition API.
